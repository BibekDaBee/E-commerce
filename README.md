- Firstly clone or unzip the project folder.
- Go to the frontend directory by using the following command `cd frontend`.
- Then run `npm install` commend to install node dependencies.
- Create an .env.local file in the root directory of the backend (at the same level as package.json) and add the following environment variables:

```
VITE_STRIPE_PK = 'your-vite-stripe-key'   
VITE_WEB3FORM_SECRET_KEY = 'your-web3form-secret-key'
```

- Finally, to run the project, use `npm run dev` command.

## Backend
To set up and run the backend:
- Clone or unzip the project folder.
- Go to the backend directory by using the following command `cd backend`.
- Then run `npm install` commend to install node dependencies.
- Create an .env file in the root directory of the backend (at the same level as package.json) and add the following environment variables:

``` 
MONGODB_URI= 'your-database-url'    
JWT_SECRET_KEY = 'your-jwt-secret'  
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = 'your-stripe-secrer-key'    
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME = 'your-cloudinary-cloud-name'    
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY= 'your-cloudinary-api-key'   
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET= 'your-cloudinary-api-secret-key' 
WEB3FORM_SECRET_KEY = 'your-web3form-secret-key'
```
- Finally to run the project use `npm run start:dev`

### Notes
- Ensure that you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
- Make sure to replace placeholders in the .env file with actual values.
- If you encounter issues, ensure that the project dependencies are installed correctly and the required services (like a database) are running.
